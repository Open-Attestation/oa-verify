Todo

1. Generate sample document for
    - direct signed by eth (DID)
    - direct signed by eth and using dns proof (DNS-DID)
    - issued via document store, using did (DID-CONTRACT)
2. Write document status module for
    - DID (uses didSignedDocumentStatus)
    - DNS-DID (uses didSignedDocumentStatus)
3. Write identity module for 
    - DID (uses didIdentityProof)
    - DID-CONTRACT (uses didIdentityProof)
    - DNS-DID (uses dnsText or another one dnsDidProof)
4. Ensure existing test skips when the falls into these cases
